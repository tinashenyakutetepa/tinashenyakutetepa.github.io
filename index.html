Brief on the Nigerian University System
The development of university education in Nigeria started with the inauguration of Elliot
Commission of 1943, the report of which led to the establishment of University College,
Ibadan (UCI) as an affiliate of the University of London in 1948. In April 1959, the colonial
Government set up the Ashby Commission to advise it on the higher education needs of the
country for the first two decades. Before the submission of the report, the Eastern Region
Government established its own university, University of Nigeria, Nsukka in 1960.The
implementation of the Ashby Report led to the establishment of the regional universities in
the Western and the Northern Regions: University of Ife (now Obafemi Awolowo University),
Ile-Ife and Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria in 1962 respectively as well as a Federal university,
the University of Lagos also in1962. This also led to the establishment of the National
Universities Commission (NUC) as an administrative Unit in the Cabinet Office of the Federal
Government. The University College, Ibadan became a full-fledged University in 1963. In 1970,
the Midwestern Region (carved out of the Western Region) established the University of
Benin. The six universities are referred to as First Generation Universities.
During the third National Development Plan (1975-1980) and owing to strident demands for
more universities in the wake of the geopolitical restructuring of Nigeria into twelve States,
the Federal Government took over all the Regional (“Ashby”) universities and established
seven more universities located in Calabar, Ilorin, Jos, Sokoto, Maiduguri, Port-Harcourt and
gKano - the Second Generation Universities. The Federal Government established specialized
Universities of Technology between 1980 and early 1991 in Owerri, Makurdi, Yola, Akure and
Bauchi while a University of Agriculture was in Abeokuta. During this period, some of the
States also established universities. These were found Rivers, Anambra, Lagos, Osun, Imo,
Cross-River and Ondo States. The Federal Government also took over some State universities
as new States were carved out of existing ones and these included the Nnamdi Azikiwe
University, Awka and University of Uyo while the defunct Open University in Abuja became
the University of Abuja with a Centre for Distance Learning and another University of
Agriculture established in Umudike. The universities established during this period are the
third generation universities.
The inclusion of education on the Concurrent List in the Constitution of the Federal Republic
of Nigeria means participation of the States governments while participation by the private
sector and individuals in the delivery of education to the public was made possible by Decree
No. 9 of 1993. The public was invited to participate in offering university education in 1983
but the in-orderly manner in which all the 31 universities were established led to their closure.
However, the Federal Government suspended the closure order when Decree No. 9 of 1993
was promulgated. This has led to the orderly establishment of private universities in Nigeria,
the first three having been licensed in 1999.
Directory of Full Professors in the Nigerian University System, 2017 page 11 Draft
It should be noted that these universities were established to be citadels of learning and
development. Section 8(59) of the National Policy on Education (2014) outlined the aims of
higher education thus:
x Contribution to national development through high level manpower training.
x Development of the intellectual capabilities of the individual to understand and
appreciate their local and external environment.
x Acquisition of both physical and intellectual skills which enables the individual to be selfreliant and useful member of the society
x Promotion and encouragement of scholarship and community services.
x For national unity and the promotion of national cohesion, understanding and integration.
Section 8(60) of the document also states that higher education in Nigeria should vigorously
pursue these goals through: teaching and learning; research and development as well as
knowledge generation and dissemination and international cooperation; and dedicated
service to the communities through extra-mural and consultancy service. In spite of the
laudable goals of higher education, the Nigerian tertiary (higher) Education Sub-sector suffers
from certain challenges that have undermined the quality. These include inadequate funding,
paucity of academic staff, inadequate and deteriorating infrastructural and instructional
facilities as well as inadequate admission slots in the universities on the one hand and low
patronage of the polytechnics and colleges of education on the other hand. Proprietor
Governments and private organisations require to address these problems with the
seriousness they deserve.
By July 2017, there were over two thousand three hundred programmes across the entire
universities with academic staff strength of about 51,000. By far, however, the greatest
change has been in the explosion in student population and the number of aspirants seeking
university admission. The total student enrolment in all Nigerian universities grew from just
over 2000 in 1962 to about 1.9 million in July 2017. Over two million candidates have
registered to take the Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) in March 2018.

Minimum Standards for Attaining the Full
Professorial Rank in the Nigerian University
System
Attaining the rank of full Professor in the Nigerian university system is metaphorically like a camel
through the eye of the needle. The process is one of the most stringent in Africa and when global
comparisons are made, the minimum standards are comparable to what obtains in older university
systems in Europe and North America.
The first level qualification is to have a doctorate degree in the area of specialisation. For medical
scientists, a recognised professional Fellowship is generally accepted although in a few years’ time,
insistence on a doctorate degree in the special area of medicine with be the acceptable minimum. The
second filter is to have put in at least three years of teaching (in a university or other tertiary-level
institution), research and community service at each level of lectureship. There are four such levelsLecturer Grade 2, Lecturer Grade 1, Senior Lecturer and Associate Professor. Hence, before being
consider for promotion or appointment to the rank of full Professor, the academic/scholar would have
put in a minimum of twelve years of university teaching and research.
The third and about the most important filter is the assessment of scholarship. This involves evaluation
of the published works of the full Professorial candidate by seasoned (senior) full Professors in the
field of the candidate. Typically, a minimum of 60 internationally-published works (about 80% being
articles in high-impact international journals) will qualify a candidate to receive a positive assessment.
At least one of the assessors is expected to be from a well-ranked university outside Nigeria, preferably
from Europe or North America. At least two positive assessments will qualify the candidate for the
final step which is screening via a rigorous oral interview. The interview is a composite assessment of
the candidate on teaching (length and quality) research (scores returned by the eternal assessors) and
community service (internal and external). With an overall score exceeding a set minimum by the
university, the candidate is then processed to the University Council for appointment. The variations
from one university to another in Nigeria are marginal although the older universities would appear
to pitch higher than these minima.
