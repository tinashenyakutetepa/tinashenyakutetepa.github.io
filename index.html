Volts).
Electrical sockets (outlets) in the Arab Republic of Egypt are one of the two European standard 
electrical socket types: The "Type C" Europlug and the "Type E" and "Type F" Schuko. If your 
appliance's plug doesn't match the shape of these sockets, you will need a travel plug adapter in order

type of socket you need to plug into. If it's crucial to be able to plug in no matter what, bring an 
adapter for both types.
